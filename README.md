Programming for People
======================

This is the RevealJS presentation I gave for [Rails Girls Wellingtion](http://railsgirls.com/wellington) on June 8th 2013. It contains my draft notes as well as having the full commit history all the way through the writting process. While I am a little nervous to expose that all to the wider internet :smiley: but in the end I figure if anything that is a good reason to do it.

I have done my best to give attribution where I could (see the HTML) but if I am happy to add more or remove images if the owners of said images request it.
