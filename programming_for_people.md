Programming for People
======================

- Hello I am Samson
- And today I would like to talk to you about writing code
- Today you have all learned about programming
- When people think about programing they generally think about
  comunicating with a computer
- "It's all just 1s and 0s!" because just makes is simple...
- Originally it was very important you talked to computers as
  efficiently as possible
- As computers got faster it got easer to add levels of abstraction
  meaning you could start to write programs for people
- Grace Hopper was the first person to write a compiler
- Compilters translated human readable code into the machine code
- As computers have gotten faster we have been able to have languages
  that are easier and easier for people to read
- Ruby is a great example of this
- But lets not kid ourselves
- This [show scary method] is not that easy to read

- Lets step back for a minute
- We write programs so we can communicate with computers
- But we write these programs to people to use
- Programs are everywhere and need to be keeped up to date
- Programming has also become social
- And we are all standing on the shoulders of giants when we code
- So even if you are writing code by yourself you are likely going to
  have to read other peoples code
- And more than likely others will be reading your code
- We have got to the point where it is way more important for your code
  to be for people than for it to be for machines

- So how do we code for people?
- Object Oriented programing helps us keep our code organised
- When we write objects the goal is to make sure they only do 1 thing
- When they try to do more than one thing
- This happens [show scary code again]

- A woman named Sandi Metz has proposed 4 rules to help with this
- [show 4 rules: https://gist.github.com/henrik/4509394]
- I am going to use 1 of them to make this scarry code
- [highlight rule 2 "Your methods can be no longer than five lines of code."]
- [scary code]
- Into code that is much easier for people to read
- [fake nice method]
- [do a run though fixing scary method into nice readable small ones]
- As you can see our code is not much easier to digest
- It almost has a naritive when you read it
- The next programmer that reads your code will likely thank you for
  your small methods. Maybe even give you a hug! #FridayHug
- Thank you for your time
