            Today you has spent your time learning to comunicate with a
            computer.

            But when you are programming you are not
            just comunicating with a computer, you are also comunicating
            with people.

            It used to be very important to comunicate efficiently
            with a computer.

            But as computers got faster and there was more and more
            code being written the focus shifted.
          </p>
          <p class="fragment">
            It was also benificial for humans to be able to read code
            as easly as possible.

          <h2>It's all just 1's and 0's!</h2>

            abouth hackers.

            So back to the real world.

            The was the first step in abstraction away from the 1's and
            0's and towards code that was easier for people to read.

            A years and steps later and we now have to programming
            laguages like Ruby.
          </p>
					<blockquote class="fragment" cite="http://learnruby.com/about-ruby.html">
						&ldquo;For me, the purpose of life is, at least partly, to
            have joy. Programmers often feel joy when they can
            concentrate on the creative side of programming, so Ruby is
            designed to make programmers happy. I consider a programming
            language as a user interface, so it should follow the
            principles of user interface.&rdquo;
            -- Yukihiro Matsumoto (a.k.a. “Matz”), 2000

					<h2>A programmer named Sandi Metz proposed 4 rules to help with this</h2>
          <ol class="fragment">
            <li>Your class can be no longer than 100 lines of code.</li>
            <li>Your methods can be no longer than 5 lines of code.</li>
            <li>You can pass no more than 4 parameters and you can’t just make it one big hash.</li>
            <li>
              When a call comes into your Rails controller, you can
              only instantiate 1 object to do whatever it is that needs to be done.

            As you can see our code is not much easier to digest.
            It almost has a naritive when you read it
            The next programmer that reads your code will likely thank you for
            your small methods. Maybe even give you a hug!
