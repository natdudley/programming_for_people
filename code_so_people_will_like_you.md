Code So People Will Like You
============================

- I would like to talk to you all about writing code
- You write code to talk to a computer
- Talking to computers is hard
- Talking to people is harder
- When you are writing code you are also talking to the next person that
  reads it
- That person could be a co-worker
- Could be a stranger
- And it could be yourself in the future 
- So how to you write code so the next person that reads it likes you?
- First lets look at what does bad code looks like?
- [Show large complex method]
- This may or may not comunicate with a computer well
- But it is pretty opaque to a human
- A experienced programmer can figure out what is going on but they
  still have to trace though the code to understand it
- And when you get the error at 2am some strong language may be directed
  your way
- So how do we fix this?
- One tool to you can uses is called the Single Responsibility Principle
- The idea is that every class and method you write should just have one
  responsibility
- So lets take a look at our scary method
- [Go through parts and refactor into smaller methods]
- So now when you look back on our method it is much easier to for a
  person to read
- And from a computers point of view it still acts the same
- Computers are awesome and can do amazing things
- But programming is about people
- People that use your code
- And the people that help you write it
- So when you are programming, remember the poor people
- And they will like you
- ... and computers will always like you
